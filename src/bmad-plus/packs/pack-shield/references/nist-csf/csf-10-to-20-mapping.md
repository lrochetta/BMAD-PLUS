## Migration Checklist: CSF 1.1 → CSF 2.0

Use this checklist when transitioning an existing CSF 1.1 implementation:

**Governance (new GV function)**
- [ ] Formally document cybersecurity strategy and risk tolerance (GV.RM-01, GV.RM-02)
- [ ] Assign explicit cybersecurity roles with accountability to leadership (GV.RR-01, GV.RR-02)
- [ ] Establish a Cybersecurity Policy and review cycle (GV.PO-01, GV.PO-02)
- [ ] Create an oversight mechanism to review risk strategy outcomes (GV.OV-01 to 03)
- [ ] Expand supply chain risk management to cover GV.SC-01 through GV.SC-10
- [ ] Document organizational context and stakeholder dependencies (GV.OC-01 to 05)

**Identify updates**
- [ ] Add data and metadata inventories (ID.AM-07)
- [ ] Implement asset lifecycle management (ID.AM-08)
- [ ] Establish vulnerability disclosure process (ID.RA-08)
- [ ] Assess hardware/software authenticity before acquisition (ID.RA-09)
- [ ] Create an improvement tracking process (ID.IM-01 to 04)

**Protect updates**
- [ ] Add data-in-use protection controls (PR.DS-10)
- [ ] Integrate secure software development practices (PR.PS-06)

**Detect updates**
- [ ] Integrate threat intelligence into event analysis (DE.AE-07)
- [ ] Define and document incident declaration criteria (DE.AE-08)

**Respond updates**
- [ ] Formalize incident triage, categorization, and escalation (RS.MA-02 to 04)
- [ ] Improve incident data collection and integrity (RS.AN-07)

**Recover updates**
- [ ] Add post-incident operational norms assessment (RC.RP-04)
- [ ] Define incident recovery end criteria (RC.RP-06)
- [ ] Establish public update process for incident recovery (RC.CO-04)

## CSF Version Coexistence

Organizations with CSF 1.1 implementations do not need to immediately migrate — CSF 2.0 is backward compatible in intent. The key practical changes are:

1. **Govern is not optional**: If your organization has governance practices embedded in ID or PR, map them to the new GV function explicitly
2. **Supply chain is a first-class concern**: ID.SC (5 subcategories) must be expanded to GV.SC (10 subcategories)
3. **Improvement is now structured**: The new ID.IM category formalises what was previously ad hoc
4. **Informative References moved online**: Use the NIST CSF 2.0 Reference Tool at https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cybersecurity-framework/Filters#/csf/filters to find current informative references for each subcategory
