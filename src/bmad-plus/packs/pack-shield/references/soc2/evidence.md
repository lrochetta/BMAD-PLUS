## Evidence Fundamentals

### Type 1 vs Type 2 Evidence

| | Type 1 | Type 2 |
|---|---|---|
| **What's tested** | Control design at a point in time | Control operating effectiveness over a period |
| **Evidence needed** | Proof control *exists* and is *designed* correctly | Proof control *operated consistently* throughout the period |
| **Sampling** | Single instance is usually sufficient | Auditor will sample multiple instances across the period |
| **Typical audit period** | A date (e.g., Dec 31, 2024) | 6–12 months (e.g., Jan 1 – Dec 31, 2024) |

For Type 2, auditors typically use **statistical sampling** — for higher-frequency controls (daily logs, weekly scans), they'll pull samples from across the period. For lower-frequency controls (annual risk assessment, quarterly access reviews), they'll test every instance.

### Sampling Guidance by Control Frequency

| Frequency | Auditor sample size (typical) |
|---|---|
| Continuous / daily | 20–30 items from across the period |
| Weekly | 5–10 weeks sampled |
| Monthly | 3–6 months sampled |
| Quarterly | All 4 quarters |
| Annual | 1 (but must cover the audit period) |
| Event-driven (e.g., per hire/termination) | 20–30 events or 100% if fewer than 20 |

**Access review evidence tips:**
- Export must be dated and show reviewer name

- Entitlement changes made as a result of review should be evidenced (tickets)

## Evidence Quality Checklist

Before submitting evidence to auditors, verify:

- [ ] **Dated** — every screenshot or export clearly shows the date it was captured
- [ ] **System-identified** — it's clear which system the evidence comes from
- [ ] **Complete for period** — Type 2 evidence covers the full audit window
- [ ] **Not reconstructed** — evidence was captured at the time of control operation, not created retroactively
- [ ] **Reviewer-attributable** — approvals show who approved (not just "admin" or a shared account)
- [ ] **Named with context** — files are named clearly (e.g., `CC6.5_AccessReview_Q3-2024_Signed.pdf`, not `screenshot1.png`)
- [ ] **Organized by criterion** — evidence folder mirrors the TSC structure

## Common Evidence Pitfalls

1. **Screenshots with no date** — always capture the date/timestamp in the screenshot or use system-generated exports with metadata.

2. **"As of today" exports provided after the audit period** — access lists pulled after the fact don't prove controls operated *during* the period. Configure periodic automated exports.

3. **Approval from the same person who made the change** — self-approval violates separation of duties. Flag this for remediation before the audit.

4. **Shared or service accounts used for approvals** — individual accountability cannot be established. Require personal accounts for all approvals.

5. **Training completion reports showing < 100%** — auditors will ask about non-completers. Have a policy and evidence showing follow-up for late completers.

6. **Incomplete incident tickets** — tickets must show: detection time, severity classification, responders, containment actions, resolution, and closure. Sparse tickets are a finding.

7. **Vendor SOC 2 reports not reviewed** — simply *having* a vendor's SOC 2 report is insufficient. Show evidence it was reviewed (e.g., review memo, CUEC tracking).
