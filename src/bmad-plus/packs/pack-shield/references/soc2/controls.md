Title:         Access Termination — Employee Offboarding
Type:          Preventive
Owner:         IT / HR
Frequency:     Event-driven (each termination)
Description:   Upon employee termination, IT disables all system access within 24 hours
               of the HR-initiated offboarding ticket. A checklist confirms: AD account
               disabled, SaaS app access revoked, VPN certificate revoked, hardware
               returned. HR confirms completion in the HRIS.
Evidence:      Offboarding tickets, access revocation logs, HRIS termination records
Test:          Select sample of 10–25 terminations in audit period; verify access was
               revoked within 24 hours using AD logs and ticket timestamps.
