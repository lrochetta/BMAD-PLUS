# CMMC 2.0 — Level Comparison, Assessment Types & Flow-Down Rules

## Level Comparison Table

| Attribute | Level 1 — Foundational | Level 2 — Advanced | Level 3 — Expert |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Practices** | 17 (FAR 52.204-21) | 110 (NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2) | 110+ (SP 800-171 + SP 800-172 subset) |
| **Focus** | Federal Contract Information (FCI) | Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) | CUI on highest-priority DoD programs; APT resilience |
| **Assessment type** | Annual self-assessment | Triennial C3PAO assessment (critical) OR self-assessment (non-critical) | DIBCAC-led government assessment (triennial) |
| **SPRS submission** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Certification body** | Self | C3PAO (CMMC Third-Party Assessment Organization) | DIBCAC (Defense Industrial Base Cybersecurity Assessment Center) |
| **Conditional certification** | No | Yes (limited POA&M allowed) | No |
| **Who needs it** | All DoD contractors receiving/generating FCI | Contractors handling CUI on DoD contracts | Contractors on highest-priority programs (e.g., nuclear C3, certain weapons systems) |

## DFARS Clause Mapping

| DFARS Clause | Requirement | Level Implied |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| FAR 52.204-21 | Basic Safeguarding of FCI — 15 requirements | Level 1 baseline |
| DFARS 252.204-7012 | Safeguarding CUI; 72-hr DIBNET incident reporting; cloud = FedRAMP Moderate | Level 2 prerequisite |
| DFARS 252.204-7019 | NIST SP 800-171 self-assessment; SPRS submission required | Level 2 self-assessment |
| DFARS 252.204-7020 | DoD access to contractor assessment results in SPRS | Level 2 |
| DFARS 252.204-7021 | CMMC certification requirement; flow-down to subcontractors | Level 2 or 3 |

**Rule**: If your contract contains DFARS 252.204-7021, your CMMC level is specified in the contract. Check Section L or the Performance Work Statement.

## Assessment Process by Level

### Level 1 — Self-Assessment
1. Assess all 17 practices against FAR 52.204-21
2. Calculate and submit SPRS score (17 practices, max score = 17, each = 1 point)
3. Submit to SPRS at https://www.sprs.csd.disa.mil/
4. Senior official affirms accuracy
5. Repeat annually

### Level 2 — C3PAO Assessment (Critical Programs)
1. **Pre-assessment preparation** (6–12 months): SSP, POA&M, gap remediation
2. **Select a C3PAO**: Must be CMMC-AB authorized; find at cyberAB.us
3. **Contract with C3PAO**: Negotiate scope, timeline, NDA
4. **Assessment**: C3PAO reviews evidence, interviews, observes (typically 2–4 weeks on-site/remote)
5. **Findings**: CMMC-AB receives results; conditional certification possible with limited POA&M
6. **Certification**: Issued by CMMC-AB; valid for 3 years
7. **Annual affirmation**: Affirm continued compliance each year

### Level 2 — Self-Assessment (Non-Critical Programs)
- Same 110 practices as C3PAO path
- Self-assessed by contractor; senior official affirms in SPRS
- DoD reserves right to audit; false statements = False Claims Act liability
- Must still submit SPRS score

### Level 3 — DIBCAC Assessment
1. Contractor must hold a current Level 2 C3PAO certification first
2. DIBCAC (government team) conducts assessment — not contractor-selected
3. Assesses SP 800-171 practices PLUS select SP 800-172 enhanced requirements
4. No conditional certification — all practices must be MET
5. Government schedules the assessment; no commercial negotiation

## Flow-Down Requirements

DFARS 252.204-7021(c) requires prime contractors to:
- Include CMMC requirements in **all subcontracts** where the subcontractor processes, stores, or transmits CUI
- Specify the required CMMC level in the subcontract
- Verify subcontractor certification before award (Level 2/3 must appear in SPRS/CMMC-AB registry)
- Flow-down applies to **all tiers** — sub-subcontractors are not exempt

**Practical implication**: If you're a prime, map your CUI to each subcontractor and determine which level applies to each. Document this in your supply chain security program.
